# AGI Experiment: Advanced AI Orchestration Patterns

## A Comprehensive Knowledge Base for Human-AI Collaboration

This repository documents advanced patterns and experiments in AI orchestration, exploring the cutting edge of what's possible when humans and artificial intelligence work together as partners.

## Podcast Series Documentation

This knowledge base was created for generating an educational podcast series about advanced AI usage patterns, multi-agent orchestration, and the future of human-AI collaboration.

10. **[Best Practices Guide](podcast/10-best-practices.md)**  
    The ultimate playbook for AGI experiments, distilled from real-world experience.

## Key Concepts

- **Parallelization Over Serialization**: Why sequential thinking is obsolete
- **Memory as Foundation**: Building persistent, evolving intelligence
- **Tool Synergy**: Creating emergent capabilities through integration
- **Human Amplification**: Enhancing rather than replacing human intelligence
- **Continuous Learning**: Every interaction improves the system
