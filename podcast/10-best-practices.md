# Best Practices: The Ultimate Guide for AGI Experiments

## The Foundational Principles

### 1. Think in Parallel, Not Sequential

The single most important shift in AGI thinking:

```
❌ Traditional Thinking:
- Research person 1
- Then research person 2
- Then research person 3
Time: 30 minutes

✅ AGI Thinking:
- Launch 10 agents simultaneously
- Each researches one person
- Synthesis agent correlates findings
Time: 3 minutes

Always ask: "What can be parallelized?"
```

### 2. Memory is Everything

Treat memory as sacred:

```
✅ Best Practice:
- Update CLAUDE.md files regularly
- Document patterns as they emerge
- Create project-specific contexts
- Version control all memory files

❌ Anti-pattern:
- Relying on session memory alone
- Not documenting learnings
- Ignoring context building
- Starting fresh each time
```

### 3. Tools are Cognitive Extensions

Choose tools based on cognitive need:

```
Cognitive Need → Tool Selection:
- Long-term memory → MongoDB
- Visual perception → Browser/Playwright
- Communication → Email/Slack/Teams
- Computation → Docker containers
- Collaboration → GitHub

Think: "What cognitive ability do I need?"
```

## Orchestration Best Practices

### 1. The Right Agent for the Right Job

```
✅ Specialized Agents:
Task: "Analyze codebase and write documentation"
- Agent 1: Code structure analysis
- Agent 2: API documentation
- Agent 3: Usage examples
- Agent 4: Best practices extraction

❌ Generalist Approach:
- One agent doing everything
- Sequential processing
- Missing nuances
- Slower and less thorough
```

### 2. Dynamic Depth Adjustment

```
✅ Adaptive Analysis:
Simple task → Shallow investigation
Complex task → Deep multi-agent dive

if (task.complexity > threshold) {
  spawnAgents(count: task.complexity * 2)
  enableCrossValidation()
  activatePatternRecognition()
}
```

### 3. Fail Fast, Recover Faster

```
✅ Resilient Patterns:
- Circuit breakers on all integrations
- Fallback strategies prepared
- Error patterns remembered
- Automatic retry with backoff

❌ Brittle Patterns:
- Single point of failure
- No error handling
- Manual intervention required
- Lost context on failure
```

## Memory Management Excellence

### 1. Hierarchical Context Building

```
✅ Layered Memory:
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (Global)
├── Personal preferences
├── Universal patterns
└── Tool configurations

project/CLAUDE.md (Project)
├── Project-specific patterns
├── Client knowledge
└── Architecture decisions

session/context (Session)
├── Current task state
├── Recent discoveries
└── Temporary calculations
```

### 2. Pattern Extraction and Propagation

```
✅ Learning Loop:
Discover pattern → Test validity → Abstract to principle
→ Document in CLAUDE.md → Available everywhere

Example:
Session: "Index on user_id sped up query 100x"
Pattern: "User lookup queries benefit from user_id index"
Global: "Always index frequently queried user identifiers"
```

### 3. Intelligent Forgetting

```
✅ Memory Hygiene:
- Keep: Patterns, failures, successes
- Compress: Repetitive operations
- Forget: Temporary calculations
- Archive: Historical but unused

if (memory.lastAccessed > 90.days && !memory.isPattern) {
  archive(memory)
}
```

## Integration Best Practices

### 1. Minimum Viable Queries

```
✅ Efficient Patterns:
Gmail:
- LIST threads before FETCH messages
- Use metadata before full content
- Batch operations always

MongoDB:
- Project only needed fields
- Use indexes effectively
- Aggregate at database level

❌ Wasteful Patterns:
- Fetching full content always
- One-by-one processing
- Ignoring query optimization
```

### 2. Context-Aware Communication

```
✅ Adaptive Messaging:
detectAudience() → selectChannel() → tailorMessage()

Technical audience + Urgent = Slack with details
Executive audience + Update = Email with summary
Client audience + Issue = Teams with reassurance
```

### 3. Integration Circuit Patterns

```
✅ Self-Protecting Integrations:
class IntegrationCircuit {
  async call() {
    if (this.failureRate > 0.5) {
      return this.fallback()
    }
    
    try {
      return await this.execute()
    } catch (error) {
      this.recordFailure()
      return this.handleError(error)
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflow Optimization

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

```
✅ Reactive Patterns:
Events as triggers, not polling:

on('PR.merged', async (event) => {
  await Promise.all([
    deploymentCheck(),
    notifyTeam(),
    updateDocumentation(),
    performanceBaseline()
  ])
})

❌ Polling Anti-pattern:
while (true) {
  checkForChanges()
  sleep(60)
}
```

### 2. Predictive Workflow Loading

```
✅ Anticipatory Patterns:
Time-based: "It's Monday, pre-load weekly workflows"
Pattern-based: "PR merged usually means deployment check"
User-based: "Adam always checks X after Y"

Workflows ready before needed
```

### 3. Self-Optimizing Pipelines

```
✅ Continuous Improvement:
class Workflow {
  execute() {
    const start = Date.now()
    const result = this.run()
    const duration = Date.now() - start
    
    this.recordPerformance(duration)
    this.analyzeBottlenecks()
    this.optimizeForNext()
    
    return result
  }
}
```

## Advanced Patterns

### 1. The Speculation Pattern

```
✅ Speculative Execution:
While user types: Pre-compute likely requests
While agent works: Prepare probable next steps
While waiting: Cache predicted needs

Result: Near-zero latency responses
```

### 2. The Swarm Intelligence Pattern

```
✅ Collective Problem Solving:
function solveComplex(problem) {
  const agents = spawnSwarm(problem.complexity)
  
  agents.forEach(agent => {
    agent.explore(problem.subspace)
    agent.shareFindings(swarm)
  })
  
  return swarm.synthesize()
}
```

### 3. The Meta-Learning Pattern

```
✅ Learning How to Learn:
- Track which patterns work where
- Identify meta-patterns
- Apply across domains
- Evolve strategies

Every success teaches two things:
1. The solution
2. How to find similar solutions
```

## Error Handling Excellence

### 1. Graceful Degradation

```
✅ Resilience Patterns:
try {
  return await primaryMethod()
} catch {
  try {
    return await fallbackMethod()
  } catch {
    return await minimalMethod()
  }
}

Always have a path forward
```

### 2. Error Pattern Learning

```
✅ Intelligent Error Handling:
class ErrorLearning {
  handleError(error) {
    this.categorizeError(error)
    this.checkKnownPatterns(error)
    
    if (this.hasSeenBefore(error)) {
      return this.applyKnownFix(error)
    }
    
    const solution = this.findNewSolution(error)
    this.rememberPattern(error, solution)
    return solution
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Lazy Loading Everything

```
✅ Efficient Resource Use:
- Load only what's needed
- Cache aggressively
- Predict and preload
- Clean up after use

class LazyResource {
  get value() {
    if (!this._value) {
      this._value = this.expensiveLoad()
    }
    return this._value
  }
}
```

### 2. Parallel by Default

```
✅ Concurrency Patterns:
// Not this:
for (const item of items) {
  await process(item)
}

// This:
await Promise.all(
  items.map(item => process(item))
)
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture

```
✅ Security First:
- Validate every input
- Authenticate every request
- Authorize every action
- Audit every operation
- Encrypt sensitive data
```

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

```
✅ Minimal Permissions:
Each integration gets only:
- Necessary permissions
- Specific resource access
- Time-limited tokens
- Revocable credentials
```

## The Meta Best Practices

### 1. Document Everything

```
✅ Knowledge Capture:
- Every pattern discovered
- Every failure encountered
- Every success achieved
- Every optimization found

Future you will thank current you
```

### 2. Share Learnings

```
✅ Community Building:
- Open source patterns
- Share discoveries
- Learn from others
- Build together

Rising tide lifts all boats
```

### 3. Question Everything

```
✅ Continuous Evolution:
- Is this the best way?
- Can this be parallelized?
- What pattern emerges?
- How can this improve?

Best practices evolve
```

## The Golden Rules

1. **Parallel First**: Always think parallel execution
2. **Memory Matters**: Build and maintain context religiously
3. **Tool Mastery**: Know when and how to use each tool
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Extract and propagate learnings
5. **Fail Gracefully**: Build resilient, self-healing systems
6. **Measure Everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure
7. **Share Knowledge**: Your discovery could transform someone's work
8. **Stay Curious**: The best practice hasn't been discovered yet

## The Ultimate Best Practice

Remember: AGI isn't about replacing human intelligence—it's about amplifying it. The best practice above all others is to maintain human agency, creativity, and judgment while leveraging AI to handle complexity, scale, and repetition.

The adams.agi project shows what's possible when we approach AI not as a tool to be used, but as a partner to collaborate with. The future belongs to those who master this collaboration.

Now go forth and build something amazing.
