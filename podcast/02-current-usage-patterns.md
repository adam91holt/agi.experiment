# Current Usage Patterns: How Adam Orchestrates AI Today

## The Daily Reality

Every morning at 9 AM Auckland time, Adam doesn't just open a terminal—he activates a complex AI orchestration system that transforms how work gets done. Let's peek behind the curtain at how Claude Code is being used in ways that would seem like science fiction just a year ago.

## The Power User's Toolkit

### 1. Parallel Research Operations

When Adam needs to research multiple topics or people, he doesn't queue them up one by one. Instead:

```
"Research these 10 people for our upcoming conference"
```

What happens next is remarkable. Claude Code spawns 10 independent agents using the Task tool, each diving deep into research about one person. While agent #1 is analyzing LinkedIn profiles, agent #5 is scanning recent publications, and agent #8 is checking GitHub contributions. All simultaneously. What would take hours sequentially completes in minutes.

### 2. The Incident Response Orchestra

When an incident occurs at one of the Rapido clients, Adam's response is a carefully choreographed performance:

1. **Information Gathering**: Multiple agents spawn to check MongoDB logs, system metrics, and error reports
2. **Analysis**: While gathering continues, other agents begin pattern matching against previous incidents
3. **Communication**: Simultaneously, agents draft notifications for Teams and Slack, each formatted appropriately
4. **Documentation**: Another agent begins creating the incident report structure
5. **Resolution Tracking**: A final agent sets up monitoring for the fix

All of this happens in parallel, turning what could be a chaotic scramble into a smooth, efficient response.

### 3. Codebase Archaeology

Adam's approach to understanding large codebases showcases advanced patterns:

- **Batch File Operations**: Instead of reading files one by one, he'll instruct Claude Code to read 20 files in a single operation
- **Parallel Search Patterns**: Multiple grep and glob operations run simultaneously across different directories
- **Contextual Analysis**: While some agents search, others are already analyzing the found patterns

### 4. The TODO List Revolution

Unlike traditional task management, Adam uses TodoWrite as a dynamic orchestration tool:

- Tasks aren't just items to complete—they're work units that can be parallelized
- Complex projects get broken down into atomic operations
- Each todo item can spawn its own agent swarm
- Progress tracking happens in real-time across all parallel operations

## Real-World Integration Patterns

### MongoDB Mastery

With 10 Rapido clients running databases from a few hundred MB to over 6GB, Adam's MongoDB integration patterns are sophisticated:

```
# Not this (sequential):
Check haydn-live collections → Check schema → Run query → Check next database

# But this (parallel):
- Agent 1: Analyze haydn-live (92 collections)
- Agent 2: Profile bw-live performance (6.37GB)
- Agent 3: Compare schemas across all databases
- Agent 4: Generate optimization recommendations
```

### Communication Symphony

Adam's multi-channel communication showcases true integration mastery:

- **Gmail**: Batch operations to scan threads without loading full content
- **Teams**: HTML-formatted messages with proper styling posted to specific channels
- **Slack**: Completion notifications for long-running operations
- **GitHub**: Parallel PR reviews across RapidoNZ and vochub-tech organizations

### The Git Workflow Revolution

Instead of the traditional linear git workflow, Adam uses:

```
Parallel Operations:
- Git status
- Git diff
- Git log
- Recent commit analysis
All executing simultaneously, providing instant comprehensive repository state
```

## Advanced Patterns in Practice

### 1. The Context Preservation Network

Adam maintains context across multiple levels:
- **Global**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with personal preferences and tool configurations
- **Project**: Individual `CLAUDE.md` files for each project
- **Session**: Dynamic context built through agent interactions
- **Tool-Specific**: Dedicated configuration files for each integration

### 2. Intelligent Batching Decisions

Adam has developed an intuition for when to batch vs. when to go sequential:

**Batch Everything**:
- Multiple file reads
- Database queries across different collections
- Web fetches from different sites
- Independent research tasks

**Stay Sequential**:
- Multiple edits to the same file
- Architecture before implementation
- Build → Test → Fix cycles
- Dependent database operations

### 3. The Efficiency Multiplier

By leveraging these patterns, Adam achieves:
- **10x speedup** on research tasks
- **5x faster** incident response
- **Parallel testing** across multiple environments
- **Simultaneous documentation** while coding

## The Hidden Patterns

### Memory Management Excellence

Adam's approach to memory is sophisticated:
- Never fetches full email content unless necessary
- Uses metadata queries for Gmail scanning
- Leverages list operations before detailed fetches
- Maintains a mental model of what's already in context

### Tool Selection Mastery

The choice of tool reveals deep understanding:
- **Task tool**: For complex searches and parallel operations
- **Direct tools**: For specific, targeted operations
- **Bash**: For system operations and git workflows
- **MCP tools**: For deep integrations with external services

### Workflow Optimization

Adam has developed workflows that would be impossible without AI:
1. **Parallel Code Review**: Reviewing multiple PRs simultaneously
2. **Cross-Database Analysis**: Comparing patterns across all client databases at once
3. **Multi-Repository Search**: Finding patterns across entire organizations
4. **Automated Incident Triage**: Immediate multi-dimensional incident analysis

## The Daily Impact

What does this mean in practical terms?

- **Morning Standup Prep**: What took 30 minutes now takes 3
- **Incident Response**: 45-minute scrambles become 5-minute orchestrated responses  
- **Code Reviews**: Sequential 2-hour sessions become 20-minute parallel operations
- **Research Tasks**: Day-long investigations complete in under an hour

## The Learning Curve

This didn't happen overnight. Adam's journey shows clear evolution:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic command execution
2. **Phase 2**: Discovery of parallel capabilities
3. **Phase 3**: Integration pattern development
4. **Phase 4**: Workflow optimization
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced orchestration mastery

## What's Actually Happening

When Adam types a request, he's not just getting an AI response. He's:
- Activating a network of specialized agents
- Leveraging years of pattern development
- Applying context from multiple sources
- Orchestrating tools in sophisticated combinations
- Creating outcomes impossible for humans alone

The adams.agi project isn't just using AI—it's redefining what it means to work with artificial intelligence. And this is just the beginning.
